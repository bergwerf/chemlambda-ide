Chemlambda IDE
==============
This is the IDE for Chemlambda. It is only a proof-of-concept and due to a lack
of time I am currently not developing it any further. Chemlambda is a graphic
representation of lambda calculus created by Marius Buliga, see:
http://chorasimilarity.github.io/chemlambda-gui/. Please feel free to fork this
repository or create pull requests.

To setup the Git hooks, please run `./setup.sh` from the root of the repository.
